# helium

## what and why?
Helium is a "floating" window manager written in C over the xlib library.
It aims to create a mostly keyboard centric workflow through the use of sxhkd.
In writing **helium** my main focus was learning to write C in a useful way,
as well as, making software that I would actually use.
I liked the idea of rounded corners and I wished that other wms had tags the way that CWM does.
Thus, I made my own<F16>.
