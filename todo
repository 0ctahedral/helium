Issues:
	windows remapping to empty screen arent focused color
Basic window management:
[ ] Map window
    [x] reparent
    [x] decorate frame
    [x] write title
    [ ] add border
[ ] Movement
    [ ] snap to grid
    [ ] move in cardinal directions
		[ ] make move relative and move the same command (mov 0 0 would be absolute while move +1 +0 would not)
[ ] Focus
    [x] update colors
    [x] prev/next
    [ ] cardinal directions
[ ] Tags
    [x] 0 is tagless
    [x] add/remove window from tag
    [x] toggle individual tags
    [ ] hide/show all tags except for selected
[ ] Monitors
    [ ] update on changes
    [ ] one instace of each tag (switches based on focused monitor)
[ ] Documentation
		[ ] core functionality
		[ ] helium ctrl
[ ] Misc
		[ ] restructure the commands (maybe use a general function signature to make parsing easier)

Goodies:
 [ ] Tabbing
 [ ] Rounded corners
